# Military Communication Protocols

## Communication Security Principles

### OPSEC (Operational Security)

Operational Security is the process of protecting critical information from adversaries:

1. **Identify Critical Information**: Determine what information needs protection
2. **Analyze Threats**: Identify who might want to exploit the information
3. **Analyze Vulnerabilities**: Identify weaknesses in current security
4. **Assess Risk**: Determine the impact if information is compromised
5. **Apply Countermeasures**: Implement protective measures

### Communication Classification

#### RESTRICTED

- Lowest level of classified information
- Unauthorized disclosure could cause damage to national security
- Examples: Training manuals, administrative procedures

#### CONFIDENTIAL

- Medium level classification
- Unauthorized disclosure could cause serious damage
- Examples: Personnel records, operational schedules

#### SECRET

- High level classification
- Unauthorized disclosure could cause grave damage
- Examples: Tactical plans, intelligence reports

#### TOP SECRET

- Highest level classification
- Unauthorized disclosure could cause exceptionally grave damage
- Examples: Strategic war plans, sensitive intelligence sources

### Standard Radio Procedure

1. **Call Sign**: Identify who you're calling and who you are
2. **Message**: Deliver the message clearly and concisely
3. **Over**: Used to indicate end of transmission, expecting response
4. **Out**: Used to indicate end of communication
5. **Roger**: Message received and understood
6. **Wilco**: Will comply with instructions
7. **Say Again**: Request repetition
8. **Read Back**: Confirm critical information by repeating

### Example Radio Communication

```
"Charlie One, this is Alpha Three, over"
"Alpha Three, Charlie One, send your message, over"
"Charlie One, requesting permission to advance to checkpoint Bravo, over"
"Alpha Three, permission granted. Proceed with caution. Enemy activity reported in sector, over"
"Wilco, Charlie One. Moving to checkpoint Bravo. Alpha Three, out"
```

## Secure Communication Methods

### Encryption

- All sensitive communications must be encrypted
- Use approved cryptographic devices and software
- Regularly update encryption keys
- Never transmit classified information over unsecured channels

### Burst Transmission

- Minimize transmission time to avoid detection
- Prepare messages before transmitting
- Use compressed data formats

### Frequency Hopping

- Rapidly switch between multiple frequencies
- Prevents eavesdropping and jamming
- Coordinated between sender and receiver

## Digital Communication Security

### Best Practices

1. Use VPN for all remote communications
2. Enable two-factor authentication
3. Use strong, unique passwords
4. Regularly update software and systems
5. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive communications
6. Never share credentials
7. Report suspicious activity immediately

### Email Security

- Use encrypted email services for classified information
- Verify recipient addresses before sending
- Include classification markings in subject and body
- Use digital signatures for authentication

## Emergency Communication Codes

### SITREP (Situation Report)

Standard format for reporting situation:

- DATE-TIME-GROUP
- LOCATION
- FRIENDLY FORCES
- ENEMY FORCES
- ACTIVITY
- ASSESSMENT
- RECOMMENDATIONS

### Brevity Codes (Common)

- **CONTACT**: Engaged with enemy
- **BREAK CONTACT**: Disengage from enemy
- **CASEVAC**: Casualty evacuation required
- **MEDEVAC**: Medical evacuation required
- **RESUPPLY**: Ammunition/supplies needed
- **REINFORCEMENT**: Additional troops needed
- **CHECKPOINT**: Location verification point
